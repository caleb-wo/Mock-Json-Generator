# Mock JSON Generator

## Description

This is a commandline tool which generates mock json data into a file. I'm making it to help with prototyping & JSON decoding. It takes user arguments & generates JSON with user defined keys & data (word, short phrase, long text, number, etc.).

### Additional Context

I've been interested with Angular & Typecsript for a long time. Furthermore, my enjoyment of iOS development with Swift & SwiftUI has made me more interested in learning both! Angular & SwiftUI have a lot of similarities, so naturally, I'm excited to learn! I've wanted to work on something like this, so I thought I'd build it to use it & to get my hands on Typescript.
